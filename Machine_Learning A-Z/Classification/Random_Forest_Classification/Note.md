## It is a type of ensemble learning.
## As a forest is a collection of trees, Random Forest is a collection of Decision Trees.
## It is a powerful algorithm and is used in many applications.

### (Putting multiple ml algorithms togheter to create one bigger ML algorithm that leverages many other ML algorithms.)
