#  Supervised Learning 
## For Supervised models, we have input data and Annotated output data for training the model for prediction.

# Unsupervised Learning
## For Unsupervised models, we have input data but no annotated output data for training the model for prediction. In this case model tries to find the hidden patterns in the data.
